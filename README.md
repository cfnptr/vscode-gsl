# Garden Shading Language (GSL)

GSL is a custom shader language based on [GLSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language). It was created for the [Garden](https://github.com/cfnptr/garden) game engine
to simplify and standardize shader development. In the engine's repository, you can also find a compiler. Documentation with language changes is [here](https://github.com/cfnptr/garden/blob/main/docs/gsl.md).
